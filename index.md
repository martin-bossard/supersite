### Ph.D. Research focus

During my Ph.D. I worked on visual perception of self-motion and path integration in a traveled distance estimation task. More particularly, I am interested in the role of the visual consequences of locomotion (especially head motion during natural walking) in self-motion perception. I am currently working on self-motion perception during treadmill walking with the presence or not of viewpoint oscillations and I am also conducting further experiments involving a continuous pointing task.
